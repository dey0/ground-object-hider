# RuneLite Ground Object Hider Plugin
This plugin was originally written by [Leo288](https://github.com/Leo288).
It intends to improve performance on low-end devices, as well as removing visual distractions from the game.


## Using the Ground Object Hider
Download the plugin from the RuneLite Plugin Hub.

You should then see a new entry under the Settings panel: "Object Hider". You can click it to configure:
- The key binding for choosing a tile that contains a Ground Object to hide
- The list of Ground Objects to hide. This shouldn't need to be edited by hand -- instead, use the selector (below).

## Removing Ground Objects
By default, no objects will be hidden, and each must be manually added using the selector tool.

The way to select Ground Objects to hide is to hold the key binding (ie: Ctrl+Shift) and right-click on a tile in game. You'll see a magenta border drawn around the currently highlighted tile when in this mode.
